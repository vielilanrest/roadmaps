- The exploration of Skye's origins and her transformation into an Inhuman, a person with latent abilities activated by the Terrigen Mist. Skye learns that her real name is Daisy Johnson, that her father is Calvin Zabo (also known as Mr. Hyde), a doctor with enhanced strength and rage, and that her mother was Jiaying, an Inhuman leader who can heal from any injury. Skye also develops the power to manipulate vibrations, which allows her to create earthquakes.
- The return of Grant Ward, a former S.H.I.E.L.D. agent who was revealed to be a Hydra sleeper agent in Season 1.

Ward also tries to reconnect with his former teammates, especially Skye, but faces their distrust and hostility.
- The crossover with Avengers: Age of Ultron, where Coulson's team helps Nick Fury locate Loki's scepter and the Helicarrier, which are used by the Avengers to stop Ultron's plan to destroy humanity. Coulson also contacts Maria Hill to warn her about the threat of Theta Protocol, a secret project involving powered people.
- The emergence of the Inhumans as a new faction in the MCU, who have been living in secret for centuries under the guidance of Jiaying. The Inhumans have different opinions on how to deal with humans and S.H.I.E.L.D., which leads to a conflict that culminates in a battle at Afterlife, their hidden city.
